    <h1>INGREDIENTS REQUIRED</h1>

    2
  tablespoons dried yeast granules (or 2 packages active dry yeast)

  <br>4
cups unbleached bread flour, unbleached

  <br>3
teaspoons salt

  <div class="instructions"> <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>


<br>Bread:<br>
<h4>step 1</h4>
Dissolve the yeast in one cup of lukewarm water in a large bowl.
<h4>step 2</h4>
After a minute or two, add one cup of flour and mix. <br>
<h4>step 3</h4>
Then add a second cup and knead by hand until smooth; the dough should be dry and not stick to your hands.
<h4>step 4</h4>
Cover the bowl with a towel and let the dough rise overnite at room temperature.
The next day, punch the dough down and add 3/4 of a cup of lukewarm water, the salt and the remaining flour, one cup at a time, mixing all the while.
<h4>step 5</h4>
If you are using a stand mixer, use your dough hook; otherwise knead by hand, working the dough until dry.
<h4>step 6</h4>
Now, either knead for several more minutes in your stand mixer or place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for a good five minutes.
<h4>step 7</h4>
Now, take the dough on your board and pound it heavily with a rolling to flatten it.
Fold the dough and pound it again until flat.
<h4>step 8</h4>
Repeat this process 7 or 8 more times.
<h4>step 7</h4>
Now let the dough (and the cook) rest for ten minutes.
Form the dough into a ball, place on a board or counter and cover with plastic wrap.
Let the dough rise for two and a half hours at room temperature.
<h4>step 8</h4>
Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees.
With a small, sharp knife, make five parallel cuts, approximately 1/4" deep, along the top of the loaf.
Place the loaf on a lightly buttered cookie sheet and bake for 40 minutes or until browned and hollow sounding when knock on the bottom.
