         <h2>The Start of Something <em>exquisite</em></h2>
        <p>It all started with the desire to serve something sweet after a meal and it evolved into the decadent world we know today.
          Fruits and cheese were not enough for the French people so a new type of art –
          the art of pastries and confectionaries – was born and a whole new world of cakes, pastries, and delicious confectionaries has come to life.
          In 1270 when Régnaut-Barbon decided he wants to make oublies (confectioners’ ancestors) and pastries. And from there,
          everything started to develop and to grow into the amazing industry that French pastry and confectionary is today.</h1>

        <h2>The <em>beginning</em> of a new end </h2>
        <p>  Now that you know the most important moments in the history of French pastry and confectionary,
              it is time to talk about what makes French pastry and confectionary so special.
              What’s the secret? Or is there a secret that the world doesn’t know?
              You might have noticed that French pastries are very flaky and that’s because French cooks use a lot of butter to make them.
              Not to mention the fact that it takes a lot of time and effort to create that perfect flaky texture and amazing taste.
              Some French desserts such as chocolate mousse or fruit-based mousse are very fluffy and
              light but meringues can also be characterized as fluffy and light even though the texture is completely different.
              French desserts are also creamy and rich and that’s usually because French confectioners know how to make the best custard cream.
              The French desserts we love so much incorporate at least two of the characteristics mentioned above. Creating the amazing French pastries and
              confectionaries is a long process that takes several hours and it involves a lot of dedication and attention to details so you can say the secret lies in the technique and passion,
              not in the ingredients. We can also say that during all the centuries of experimenting with recipes and techniques, French confectioners discovered how to combine various textures
              and tastes to obtain the best pastry or the best dessert.
