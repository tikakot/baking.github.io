    BREAD <br>
    2 3⁄4 cups warm water (105 F to 115 F) <br>
    2 1⁄4 teaspoons dry yeast (1 packet) <br>

  <div class="instructions"> <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
Starter:<br>
Mix water and honey in medium bowl.<br>
Add yeast; stir to dissolve. <br>
Let stand until foamy, 10 minutes. <br>
Add 1/2 cup rye flour and 1/2 cup bread flour; stir to combine. <br><br>
Add remaining 1/2 cup rye flour. Mix in enough bread flour to form shaggy mass that can be worked with hands.<br>
<br>Turn out starter onto floured surface; knead 3 minutes, adding more bread flour if too sticky to work. (Starter will be doughlike in texture at this point.)<br>
<br>Sprinkle 1 tablespoon bread flour in medium bowl. Add starter dough to bowl. Cover with plastic; let stand at room temperature overnight (starter will lose its shape and spread to a thick batter). <br>
<br>

<br>Bread:<br>
<br>Place 1/4 cup warm water in small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over; stir to dissolve. <br>
<br>Mix 3 cups bread flour and rye flour in bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with dough hook. <br>
<br>Add yeast mixture and remaining 2 1/2 cups warm water; mix on low speed to blend. <br>
<br>Add 1 cup bread flour; beat 4 minutes. Add enough bread flour to form shaggy mass; beat 4 minutes. <br>
<br>Add salt and starter; continue mixing until dough pulls away from sides of bowl, adding more bread flour if too sticky to form dough, about 5 minutes. <br>
<br>Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface; turn to coat. Transfer dough to large bowl. Cover with kitchen towel. Let rise at room temperature 1 hour. <br>
<br>Generously flour 1 heavy large baking sheet and 1 heavy medium baking sheet. Punch dough down. Turn out onto floured surface. Knead until smooth, 2 minutes. <br>
<br>Divide into 3 equal portions. Shape each into ball. place 2 balls on large sheet and 1 on medium sheet. <br>
<br>Cover with kitchen towels. Let rise at room temperature until doubled (test by pressing 2 fingers gently into dough; if indentations remain, dough has risen completely), about 2 hours.
<br>Preheat ove to 450°F Place baking pan in bottom of oven; add water to create steam. Using sharp knife, cut 3 diagonal slits across top of each loaf. <br>
<br>Place baking sheet with 2 loaves in oven. Bake until breads are deep brown and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 35 minutes.<br>
<br> Transfer to rack and cool.</div>
