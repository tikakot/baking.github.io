    <h1>INGREDIENTS REQUIRED</h1>

  1 package dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
  <br>1 1/4 cups warm water (100° to 110°)
  <br>3 cups bread flour, divided (about 14 1/4 ounces)

  <div class="instructions"> <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
Starter:<br>
<h4>step 1</h4>
Mix water and honey in medium bowl.
<h4>step 2</h4>
Add yeast; stir to dissolve. 
<h4>step 3</h4>
Let stand until foamy, 10 minutes.
<h4>step 4</h4>
Add 1/2 cup rye flour and 1/2 cup bread flour; stir to combine.
<h4>step 5</h4>
Add remaining 1/2 cup rye flour. Mix in enough bread flour to form shaggy mass that can be worked with hands.<br>
<h4>step 6</h4>Turn out starter onto floured surface; knead 3 minutes, adding more bread flour if too sticky to work. (Starter will be doughlike in texture at this point.)
<h4>step 7</h4>Sprinkle 1 tablespoon bread flour in medium bowl. Add starter dough to bowl. Cover with plastic; let stand at room temperature overnight (starter will lose its shape and spread to a thick batter). 


<br>Bread:<br>
<h4>step 1</h4>Place 1/4 cup warm water in small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over; stir to dissolve. 
<h4>step 2</h4>Mix 3 cups bread flour and rye flour in bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with dough hook. 
<h4>step 3</h4>Add yeast mixture and remaining 2 1/2 cups warm water; mix on low speed to blend. 
Add 1 cup bread flour; beat 4 minutes. Add enough bread flour to form shaggy mass; beat 4 minutes. <br>
<h4>step 4</h4>Add salt and starter; continue mixing until dough pulls away from sides of bowl, adding more bread flour if too sticky to form dough, about 5 minutes. 
Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface; turn to coat. Transfer dough to large bowl. Cover with kitchen towel. Let rise at room temperature 1 hour. 
<h4>step 5</h4>Generously flour 1 heavy large baking sheet and 1 heavy medium baking sheet. Punch dough down. Turn out onto floured surface. Knead until smooth, 2 minutes. 
<h4>step 6</h4>Divide into 3 equal portions. Shape each into ball. place 2 balls on large sheet and 1 on medium sheet. 
<h4>step 7</h4>Cover with kitchen towels. Let rise at room temperature until doubled (test by pressing 2 fingers gently into dough; if indentations remain, dough has risen completely), about 2 hours.
<h4>step 8</h4>Preheat ove to 450°F Place baking pan in bottom of oven; add water to create steam. Using sharp knife, cut 3 diagonal slits across top of each loaf. 
<h4>step 9</h4>Place baking sheet with 2 loaves in oven. Bake until breads are deep brown and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 35 minutes.
<h4>step 10</h4>Transfer to rack and cool.</div>
