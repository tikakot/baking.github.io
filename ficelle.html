    <h1>INGREDIENTS REQUIRED</h1>

10 ounces (283 grams) (2 cups) King Arthur Flour unbleached all purpose flour (or any brand)
  <br>1 teaspoon salt

  <br>3/4 teaspoon instant yeast

  <br>3/4 teaspoon diastatic malt powder (optional)
  <br>8 ounces (1 cup) room temperature water

  <br>8 ounces (1 cup) room temperature water

  <div class="instructions"> <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>


<br>Bread:<br>
<h4>step 1</h4>
In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, salt, yeast, and malt powder. Using the dough hook on low speed, slowly add the water. When a shaggy dough forms, stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl. Turn the mixer back on, and mix for about 5 minutes on low.
<h4>step 2</h4>
Scrape the dough into an oiled container and cover with plastic wrap.
Let the dough rest for 30 minutes and then stretch and fold the dough over itself 8 times, rotating the container a quarter turn after each stretch and fold. Re-cover the container, and let rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the "stretch-and-fold" every 30 minutes three more times. <br>
<h4>step 3</h4>
After the final set of stretch-and-folds, cover the container with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the dough for 16 to 48 hours.
<h4>step 4</h4>
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Stretch it into an eight inch square. Divide the dough into four squares and cover each loosely with oiled plastic wrap. Let rest about 30 to 60 minutes, until no longer cold.
<h4>step 5</h4>
Stretch it into an eight inch square. Divide the dough into four squares and cover each loosely with oiled plastic wrap. Let rest about 30 to 60 minutes, until no longer cold.
<h4>step 6</h4>
Roll each piece of dough into a 4 inch cylinder on a lightly floured work surface. Cover each with oiled plastic wrap, and let rest for 30 minutes. With a baking stone set on the lower middle rack, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.
<h4>step 7</h4>
Spread the seed mixture evenly in a rimmed baking sheet. Spray the underside of a couche or linen with water, and drape it over a rimmed baking sheet. Dust it with flour (I use a mixture of wheat and rice flour).
<h4>step 8</h4>
 Gently press one of the dough pieces into a 6 inch by 4 inch rectangle, fold the upper 6 inch side toward the middle and press and seal. Fold the bottom 6 inch side toward the middle and seal. You should have an 8 inch by 2 inch rectangle.
<h4>step 9</h4>
Fold the dough in half lengthwise, and seal the edges together with your thumb. Pinch the seal together.
<h4>step 10</h4>
Beginning in the middle of the dough, roll the dough out with your hands, moving them gently back and forth, to form a 15 inch long by 1 inch wide cylinder. Roll your hands back and forth over the ends of the dough to form pointy ends.
<h4>step 11</h4>
Spray the cylinder with water, and roll it in the seed mixture. Transfer the seeded loaf, seam side up, to the couche and pull up the fabric on either side of the loaf into a pleat to create a cradle. Repeat with the other three dough pieces. Fold the ends of the couche over the loaves and enclose the baking sheet in a large plastic bag<br>
<h4>step 12</h4>
Line a pizza peel horizontally with parchment paper. Unfold the couche and gently transfer each loaf with a flipping board, seam side down, to the parchment lined pizza peel. Make sure each loaf is evenly spaced apart. Slash the loaves with 3 four inch slashes on an angle along the length of the dough, or one long slash down the middle of the dough.
Carefully slide the parchment with the loaves onto the baking stone, and cover with two stacked 14 inch by 16 inch foil baking pans.
<h4>step 13</h4>
Bake for 5 minutes. Remove the pans and bake for another 10 minutes, until browned. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for 15 minutes before serving.
