    <h1>INGREDIENTS REQUIRED</h1>

    1/2 cup (120ml) water <br>
    1/2 cup (120ml) 2% or whole milk <br>
    1/4 teaspoon salt <br>
    2 teaspoons granulated sugar <br>

    4 large eggs, beaten <br>
    egg wash: 1 egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon milk or water
      </div>

  <div class="instructions"> <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
    <h4>step 1</h4>
    Make the choux pastry dough: Combine the butter, water, milk, salt, and granulated sugar together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter has melted. Bring mixture to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to low and add the flour all at once. Stir until the flour is completely incorporated and a thick dough clumps into a ball.
    <h4>step 2</h4>
    Mash the dough ball against the bottom and sides of the pan for 1 minute, which gently cooks the flour.
    <h4>step 3</h4>
    Remove from heat and transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or, if using a handheld mixer, a large mixing bowl.
    Allow to cool down for a few minutes before adding the eggs in the next step.
    <h4>step 4</h4>
    Read this step in full before starting. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the eggs in 3-4 separate additions mixing for 30 seconds between each. The mixture will look curdled at first, but will begin to come together as the mixer runs. Pour in the final addition of beaten eggs very slowly. Stop adding when the choux pastry has reached the desired texture: shiny, thick, and smooth with a pipeable consistency. I usually leave a few teaspoons of beaten egg behind, which can be used with the egg wash.
    <h4>step 5</h4>
    Your choux pastry dough is complete! You can use it immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
